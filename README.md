=========
Basically useful to create a SWING interface for Java programs based on HTML tags: especially the GridBagLayout is fully implemented as <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag including <code>colspan</code> and <code>rowspan</code> attributes as well as <code>align</code> and <code>valign</code> to align the stuff.

Currently hosted in SourceForge. To be moved in GitHub for improvements.
